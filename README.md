# Ml-Algorithms for vCare
 * Decision Tree algorithm: _CART.js_ for evaluating, if the generated data follows the guideline rules.
 * _K-Means.js_ for clustering.
 * _CollaborativeFiltering.js_ for predicting high rated activities.
 * _DeepQLearning.js_ for a deep q learning agent. Uses [Karapathy's Reinforce.js](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs)
 * All algorithms can be trained by CSV files.
* _An example of use will be given in future._
